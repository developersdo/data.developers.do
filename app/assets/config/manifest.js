// Application assets manifest
// This file is used by Sprockets to determine which assets to load

// If you want to add JavaScript files:
// //= link_tree ../javascripts

// If you want to add CSS files:
// //= link_directory ../stylesheets

// If you want to add image files:
// //= link_tree ../images

// Since this is primarily an API application, minimal assets are used.
